The ''Gossip Girl'' star lost her two small children to ex-husband Daniel Giersch. Now a top family law attorney explains what may have gone wrong with her case.</p>\r\n<p>Did Kelly Rutherford inadvertently anger Theresa Beaudet, the judge presiding over her custody battle with ex-husband Daniel Giersch?</p>\r\n<p>Is that the reason that the judge ruled that her children, son Hermes, 5, and daughter Helena, 3, would have to live in France with her ex, instead of continuing to be raised here in NYC, with her as they always had?</p>\r\n<p>That''s a strong possibility believes top Manhattan family law attorney, Malcolm Taub, a partner in Davidoff, Hutcher &amp; Citron LLP.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Family court judges don''t want one parent to try and alienate kids from the other parent. One of the characteristics of being a good parent is promoting a relationship with the other parent,&rdquo; explains Taub.</p>\r\n<p>In the judge''s decision, the judge chose to make Kelly''s ex husband the &ldquo;residential parent&rdquo; because &ldquo;Daniel facilitated the relationship of the children with Kelly&hellip; and Kelly simply has not done so,&rdquo; reports TMZ.</p>\r\n<p>The judge cited the example of Kelly repeatedly failing to put Giersch''s name on their daughter''s birth certificate, despite being asked several times by the court, TMZ writes.</p>\r\n<p>The situation now puts Kelly in a tough position believes Taub. &ldquo;Unless there is egregious evidence, a court will not overturn the order right now,&rdquo; he says. However, he does think there is hope that Kelly may be able to regain custody of her little ones in the future.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The fact that there''s a ruling doesn''t mean its written in stone.

We have set out below techniques for gift giving and other techniques you may use without incurring any gift tax. Many of these techniques will also reduce your overall income tax burden.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consider making non-taxable gifts in excess of the annual exclusion using your federal gift tax exclusion of $5.12 Million ($10.24 Million for married couples). This gifting opportunity is part of a tax law that is scheduled to expire at the end of the year and will without further action by congress revert to $1 Million on January 1, 2013. This is the largest gift tax exemption - and opportunity - in history. To take advantage of the opportunity, you may consider outright gifts or gifts in a trust including trusts for your grandchildren''s education. Gifts can be made with real estate, stock or other assets. Any gifts above the annual gift tax exclusion will require filing a gift tax return even if no tax is due.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gifts in Trust</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the tax savings, you may be uneasy about making outright gifts to your children or grandchildren, due to your loss of control over how they use the gift. This concern can be addressed by making the gifts in trust, which will allow you to determine when they receive the money and how it is to be used.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are special requirements for ensuring that a gift in trust qualifies for the annual exclusion. Usually, the trust is drafted to provide the beneficiary with temporary withdrawal rights over the gift (usually for 30 days), such that it is considered a present interest rather than one that vests in the future. Although this presents a risk of the beneficiary withdrawing the gift from the trust, the probability of your terminating any further gifts to the trust is usually sufficient to prevent this. If you are interested in making a gift in trust, we will be glad to explain how this can be done.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Charitable Gifts</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The year end is a good time to review your charitable giving to ensure that it is being done in the most tax-efficient manner. Charitable giving is a form of estate planning, because a gift to charity will never be subject to estate or gift tax appreciated assets also give you a chance to avoid capital gains by gifting appreciated stock with a low basis. If your are planning to make a large gift before January 1st, you should review its impact on your 2012 income tax liability and whether it may make sense to defer all or a portion of the gift to 2013. If the gift is of property and will require an appraisal (usually required for gifts of property with a value in excess of $5,000.00, other than publicly traded stock), we should start the process as soon as possible so that the appraisal is available before year end.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, we hope that the information in this letter is useful in your year-end gift planning.

But when you share custody of your children, you have to assume a certain amount of face-to-face time amid the endless back-and-forthing.</p>\r\n<p>Think of the clashing summer vacation plans, the who-goes-to-Lucy''s-birthday-party, the "Max forgot his homework again" at Dad''s. And those devilish contretemps that can arise if Mom, for example, decides to keep her house kosher while Dad serves the children pork chops. Or if her new boyfriend is suddenly sleeping over on "her" nights to host the children.</p>\r\n<p>Let''s just say that no matter how well ex-spouses and still-parents coordinate, there''s a good chance of teary phone calls, angry exchanges during drop-off, and all-out fights about who''s not saving enough for college, often played out smack in front of the children.</p>\r\n<p>Unless, of course, it''s all done remotely. These days, the cool aloofness of technology is helping temper sticky emotional exchanges between former spouses. And for the most part, according to divorce lawyers and joint-custody bearers, handling the details via high tech is a serious upgrade.</p>\r\n<p>It''s joint custody &mdash; at a distance.</p>\r\n<p>And it makes a big difference. Like many engaged women, Erin McGillivray, 26, broke up with her fianc&eacute; before they could marry. But unlike many engaged women, she also got pregnant. By the time the two split, their daughter was 8 months old. And now they''re tied by the bonds of parenthood for the rest of their lives.</p>\r\n<p>Ms. McGillivray, a wardrobe stylist in Minneapolis, became mired in a custody dispute with her ex over their daughter, now 2. (The court eventually awarded her joint legal and primary physical custody.)</p>\r\n<p>"Normally, when you break up with someone, you don''t have to see them constantly," Ms. McGillivray said. "Now I have to see my ex and his current fianc&eacute;e several times a week. He''ll be a presence in my life for at least 17 more years, and probably more than that."</p>\r\n<p>When they see each other in person, she said, they inevitably quarrel. And so she keeps him at a safe electronic remove. "When it comes to child arrangements," she said, "we typically communicate via e-mail. Schedules, drop-offs, pickups, sick-day care: it''s all done electronically. Neither of us wants to argue in front of our daughter, but as much as we would want to avoid it, it would happen."</p>\r\n<p>It''s not surprising that most people don''t see eye-to-eye with the person they left seething on a couples therapist''s sofa. If you didn''t get along with someone well enough to stay married, chances are you will probably disagree after you divorce.</p>\r\n<p>"People don''t want to talk to their exes because just the sound of their voice is irritating," said Randy Kessler, chair of the American Bar Association''s Family Law Section and a matrimonial lawyer in Atlanta. "But they can e-mail. They can share an online calendar. They can use any number of resources on the Internet. There are even divorce apps."</p>\r\n<p>E-mail and texting alone have practically revolutionized postdivorce family relationships. "E-mail absolutely takes away the in-your-face aggravation and emotional side of joint custody," said Lubov Stark, a divorce lawyer on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "You just write, ''I want to pick up Kimmy at 5, but I''m running late and will be there at 6.'' It''s the best thing ever."</p>\r\n<p>When Zeita Jones, a 39-year-old nurse in Los Angeles, divorced her husband of 15 years in 2010, dealing with her ex while shuffling their three children every week was difficult. "When emotions were running high at the beginning, everything was e-mail and text," Ms. Jones said. "It''s a lot easier not hearing the voice. It''s detached."</p>\r\n<p>For Cheryl Wu, a 34-year-old Manhattan pediatrician, nailing down details on a Google calendar makes all the difference. First, she and her ex-husband, who have joint legal custody (she has primary physical custody) of their 5-year-old son, will e-mail each other possible arrangements until they reach a point of agreement. Once there, it goes into the mutual calendar. Since the two separated in 2010, they have only had to talk face-to-face two or three times.</p>\r\n<p>"Everything on our calendar is jointly shared, so there''s no dispute," Ms. Wu said. "For a while, I was doing all the entering of events, but I told him to put his share in, too, and now it''s all on there."</p>\r\n<p>Such arrangements are increasingly necessary. Unlike the "Kramer vs. Kramer" 1970s, when mothers won primary custody almost by default, today''s postdivorce "bi-nuclear family" setups are more egalitarian. Almost all states now offer some kind of joint custody. Joint legal custody, in which parents share or split decision-making, is almost the norm. And while laws vary widely by state, joint physical custody, where children divide their time between their father''s and mother''s homes, is increasingly common.</p>\r\n<p>"In the ''80s, you used to see Dad on Sundays and get a Happy Meal and an ice cream cone," said Leslie Barbara, a partner in the matrimonial and family law department at Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron in Manhattan. "Now it''s all gender-neutral, and the parents each get spheres of influence. You put together what''s called an ''access schedule,'' and ''parenting coordinators'' help figure it all out."</p>\r\n<p>Former spouses aren''t the only parties to see a benefit in keeping their communiqu&eacute;s limited to the keyboard. Technology has become so commonplace in divorce arrangements that it has become part of the formal legal process, a development divorce lawyers and judges applaud. Many joint custody arrangements will stipulate weekly Skype sessions between parent and child while apart.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s all set out in detail," said Michael Kelly, a divorce lawyer and partner at Kelly, Fernandez &amp; Karney in Los Angeles. "Your phone has to be available at certain hours, and if you don''t follow the rules, it''s a good way to lose custody."</p>\r\n<p>Parents are often required to buy a cellphone for their child, and call times are recorded to ensure an adequate amount of time. "That way, Mom can''t say, ''O.K., you can talk to Daddy for two minutes, but that''s it,'' " Mr. Kelly said. And with a parent calling children directly on their phone, there''s no possibility of a bitter intermediary exchange between parent and parent.</p>\r\n<p>When relationships deteriorate to the point of renewed legal action, courts are increasingly ordering ex-couples to work out their differences via technology. A new crop of online custody tools has been specifically designed to keep sniping parents at bay.</p>\r\n<p>Sherry Thomas, 56, shares physical custody of her two teenage sons with her ex-husband in Boca Raton, Fla. But since their divorce in 2005, the arrangement has been fraught with disagreement. When Ms. Thomas requested court-mandated parent counseling, the judge ordered the two to use an online tool called Our Family Wizard instead. Now, lawyers supervise e-mail exchanges between her and her ex, ensuring that each party responds to the other in a timely manner. All e-mails are time dated and tracked. Parents can create a shared expense log and receive automated notices and reminders about parental obligations.</p>\r\n<p>"It''s a very good idea," Ms. Thomas said. "Of course, provided both parents use it. Otherwise you can just end up back in court again."</p>\r\n<p>Many see the Wizard and similar online custody management tools as a postmarriage savior, especially after old-fashioned conversation has failed. In certain highly contentious divorces, parents are expressly forbidden to use the phone unless a child has broken a leg on the tricycle or some other emergency.</p>\r\n<p>"The most hostile couples I see are the ones using the Wizard, and I think in those cases nothing would get done without it," said Fran Walfish, a Beverly Hills-based psychotherapist. "They wouldn''t have any other means of communicating if it weren''t online."</p>\r\n<p>Having negotiations set in writing (whether it''s a text, a cellphone log or an online calendar) also creates a permanent record of who did and wrote what. If somebody misbehaves, it can become evidence.</p>\r\n<p>Pam Abrams, a 54-year-old freelance writer in Manhattan, had an amicable lawyer-free divorce in 2006. But over time, relations with her ex, with whom she shares custody of two children, frayed. There have been times the two could barely speak to each other. Money was a near-constant source of tension. "When we weren''t getting along, everything was arranged by text," she said.</p>\r\n<p>But as anyone who has ever quarreled electronically knows, keyboarded messages can nonetheless get testy. Humor, irony, sarcasm and even genuine kindness get lost in the cloud. Not every nuance carries over in a hastily tapped text. And people don''t answer e-mails from their ex-husbands the same way people don''t answer e-mails from anyone they don''t feel like corresponding with. "There was a moment when things were so acrimonious, I didn''t want to be textable or e-mailable at all," Ms. Abrams recalled. Now where is the technology that can solve that?</p>', 'divorced couples, divorce lawyer ', 0x4d4f5354206469766f7263656420636f75706c657320776f756c642070726f6261626c7920707265666572206e6f7420746f207365652065616368206f746865722e204576657220616761696e2e20427574207768656e20796f7520736861726520637573746f6479206f6620796f7572206368696c6472656e2c20796f75206861766520746f20617373756d652061206365727461696e20616d6f756e74206f6620666163652d746f2d666163652074696d6520616d69642074686520656e646c657373206261636b2d616e642d666f727468696e672e20, 0, 1, 1, 1, 'Kramer-com-vs--Kramer-com', 0, ''),

According to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, about $15 billion of the money to be provided by the Senate bill would be spent between the year beginning Oct. 1, 2016, and the year ending Sept. 30, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;By definition, it&rsquo;s not an emergency if it&rsquo;s needed 10 years from now,&rdquo; Cornyn said. &ldquo;It could be handled with the regular course of business through the appropriations process.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Even Republicans whose own states are frequent victims of hurricanes have reservations about the pending Senate bill.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Being from Florida, I anticipate that one day, unfortunately, we may have another storm of that sort of magnitude.

I want to make sure that there are not things in there that don&rsquo;t belong.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The Senate Appropriations Committee measure released Wednesday is intended to pump money immediately into programs that will quickly funnel aid to people who suffered losses from the late October storm, and to allocate billions to allow for long-term planning on major projects to begin immediately.</p>\r\n<p>If the Senate bill is enacted, only about $8.97 billion would be spent in the current budget year, which ends Sept. 30, 2013, according to CBO. More than half of this, $5.3 billion, represents expected outlays from the National Flood Insurance Program. Another $1.2 billion of expected actual fiscal 2013 spending would come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency&rsquo;s Disaster Relief Fund.</p>\r\n<p>A key driver of this spending would be the Community Development Fund, which the Senate bill envisions as a flexible tool to allow communities to address a wide variety of needs, such as restoring damaged housing. Spending from that account would jump to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2014 from $75 million in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2015 spending would represent a peak for this program, with the CBO seeing $3.8 billion spent.</p>\r\n<p>Schumer said the advance funding is critical to the recovery effort. &ldquo;If a locality is going to rebuild a road or tunnel, they need to know that the money is there to sign the contract, to know that they will be reimbursed,&rdquo; Schumer said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll fix a large tunnel, the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. We&rsquo;ll fix the tunnel, about a half a mile of it this year, and then we&rsquo;ll see if we can get the money next year.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Schumer also said CBO may be looking at what happened after 2005&rsquo;s Hurricane Katrina as the model, but in that catastrophe, many people didn&rsquo;t return home and begin seeking federal aid to rebuild homes for many months.</p>\r\n<p>In general, the Senate bill closely resembles the White House&rsquo;s $60.4 billion request made on Dec. 7, but it adds some new spending not specifically mentioned in the Obama administration&rsquo;s proposal. Included would be $125 million for a Department of Agriculture watershed program that could help Colorado cope with the aftermath of the summer&rsquo;s wildfires and $50 million for the National Parks Service&rsquo;s Historic Preservation Fund.

Lindsay turned to the law.<br /><br />&ldquo;It was a defining moment,&rdquo; the Davidoff, Hutcher &amp; Citron LLP partner said in a telephone interview yesterday. &ldquo;I realized that with my law degree and knowledge of government, this was the time for me to get into the practice of law to do what I do best -- take on the government in some fashion on behalf of clients who can&rsquo;t get the government to understand what they want to do and why they want to do it.&rdquo;<br /><br />At an event today sponsored by Common Cause in Washington commemorating the 40-year anniversary of Watergate, Davidoff will be among three people attending who were on Nixon&rsquo;s top 20 enemies list, said Common Cause&rsquo;s Gary Ferdman. About 20 others who were on an expanded enemies list will either attend in person or will be represented.<br /><br />Among those on the top 20 list were labor union organizers, journalists, Nixon&rsquo;s political opponents and Hollywood celebrities, including former government adviser Morton Halperin and U.S. Representative John Conyers, who will both attend the ceremony.<br /><br />Davidoff said testimony at the time revealed that Nixon believed that Lindsay, a former ally, had the potential to hurt Nixon&rsquo;s career but was thought to be too difficult a target, making Davidoff the next best thing.<br /><br />&ldquo;I was his political lieutenant. I was in charge of his troops,&rdquo; Davidoff recalled about Lindsay. &ldquo;Take down the leadership in the field, I guess that&rsquo;s what they thought.&rdquo;<br /><br />Davidoff said he realized after the list was made public in 1974 that he had been the target of government harassment through Internal Revenue Service audits and by snooping strangers.<br /><br />Ferdman said Davidoff&rsquo;s experience showed the outrageousness of the political climate. &ldquo;He was acting as a patriotic American engaged in the political process,&rdquo; Ferdman said.<br /><br />Within a year of the announcement, Davidoff, who had left the Lindsay administration, joined a small law firm. The name has changed several times, but Davidoff, Hutcher &amp; Citron has grown to more than 50 lawyers in four offices in New York, Albany, Washington and Long Island.<br /><br />While the firm once focused primarily on government relations, it now has a broad commercial practice that includes intellectual property, trusts and estates and other matters.<br /><br />Despite the passage of time, Davidoff said he continues to be asked about the experience, which had a benefit Nixon probably couldn&rsquo;t have imagined. New clients often want to meet him because of his inclusion and the notoriety helped generate business for his practice. &ldquo;It is definitely a badge of distinction,&rdquo; he said.<br /><br />http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-12/-enemy-davidoff-nixon-peabody-bird-business-of-law.html</p>', 'government relations lawyers new york', 0x424c4f4f4d424552472020e28098456e656d79e280992044617669646f66663a20427573696e657373206f66204c6177, 0, 1, 1, 1, 'BLOOMBERG---Enemy--Davidoff--Business-of-Law', 0, 'BLOOMBERG  â€˜Enemyâ€™ Davidoff: Business of Law'),
